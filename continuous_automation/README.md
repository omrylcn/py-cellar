Current Gaps in (CI/CD/CT) Pipeline for MLOps:

State Management:
Think of our pipeline like a package delivery system. Right now, we're handing off packages (our code/models) between different departments (CI/CD/CT), but we don't have a proper tracking system. We need:

- A central way to know where everything is in the process
- Clear status updates at each stage
- Historical records of what happened
- Ability to trace issues back to their source

Automation:
Currently, we're like a factory where workers manually carry items between stations. Instead, we need:

- Automated handoffs between phases
- Smart decision-making at transition points
- Automatic validation before moving forward
- Error handling and recovery without manual intervention

Monitoring:
We're operating like a business without proper dashboards or reporting. We need:

- Real-time visibility into all processes
- Early warning systems for potential issues
- Performance metrics across all phases
- Resource usage tracking
- Historical analysis capabilities

Remote Management:
Right now, we're like a factory where you have to physically walk to each station to check on things. We need:

- Central control panel for all operations
- Ability to intervene from anywhere
- Remote troubleshooting capabilities
- Configuration management
- Emergency controls

What We Need to Design:

1. Central Management System:

- Acts as the brain of the operation
- Keeps track of all processes
- Makes decisions about transitions
- Maintains system health

2. State Tracking System:

- Records every important event
- Maintains history
- Enables auditing
- Supports debugging

3. Automation Framework:

- Handles routine operations
- Manages transitions
- Validates processes
- Responds to issues

4. Monitoring and Alerting:

- Tracks system health
- Monitors performance
- Alerts on issues
- Provides insights
